        I have met with programming at highschool and i realised that
        programming is like a hobby for me. At all the times that i have free
        time i found myself coding something. At those times i decided that
        programming will be my career path. Programming is a passion for me. I
        learned Fundamentals of object-oriented programming and procedural
        programming followed by studying on being front-end developer. For that
        purpose I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript then studied a few libraries for
        developing better projects like React.Js and Node.Js and now i am able
        to code responsive user interfaces according to UI and UX design
        standards. Last a few months i have been studying on Data structures for
        better understanding the working mechanism of most of the softwares and
        design patterns like singleton and factory. My main purpose is being
        part of the industry and becoming a well known programmer.
